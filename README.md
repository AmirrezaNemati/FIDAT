# FIDAT
Furrow Irrigation Design and Assessment Tool (FIDAT) - Version 1.0
This software provides comprehensive analysis of field conditions, calculating irrigation efficiency and assisting in the design of optimized furrow irrigation systems.
Key Features
1.	Real-time Efficiency Assessment
The software receives essential parameters like furrow width, net infiltration rate, Manning's roughness coefficient, land slope, and input flow. By analyzing these parameters the software calculates the current irrigation efficiency of the farm.
2.	Optimal Furrow Length Determination
Leveraging this data and the chosen infiltration equation, the software calculates the optimal furrow length that maximizes water use efficiency and minimizes losses.
